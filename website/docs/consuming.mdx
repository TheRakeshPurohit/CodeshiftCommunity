Running codemods is made simple through our CLI tool, [@hypermod/cli](/docs/cli).

> @hypermod/cli is responsible for running the provided transform against your entire codebase. Under the hood, it is a wrapper of jscodeshift's cli, which provides additional functionality

For usage please refer to the [@hypermod/cli API reference](/docs/cli).

## How to run Community codemods

To run a hypermod package, install and use the `@hypermod/cli`.

- **npm:** `npm install -g @hypermod/cli` or
- **yarn:** `yarn global add @hypermod/cli`

For example, say we want to run transforms for `@mylib/button` and migrate from version 13 to the latest version 14, we could run the following:

```
codemod-cli --packages @mylib/button@14.0.0 project/path/to/src
```

The following sequence of events will follow:

1. `@hypermod/cli` will then attempt to download a Hypermod package for the `@mylib/button` package matching version `14.0.0`
1. Download the package from NPM
1. Locate the `hypermod.config.js`
1. Attempt to find a `transform` for `14.0.0`
1. Run the transform against the path `project/path/to/src`

## Run codemods in sequence

It's also possible to run a series of codemods, one after the other, to migrate your usage of `@mylib/button` across multiple major versions, from say v14, v15 and finally v16. Assuming codemods for those versions exist.

This is done my providing the `--sequence` (or `-s`) flag to `@hypermod/cli`.

```
codemod-cli --packages @mylib/button@14.0.0 --sequence project/path/to/src
```

This time around, we use the provided version (14.0.0) as the start of a semver range between `14.0.0-@latest`.
We then fetch all codemods that match and run them one after another.

## Running local transforms

For local transform files, not published to the community repo, you can supply your own transform the same way you would with jscodeshift.

```
codemod-cli --transform path/to/transform.ts project/path/to/src
```

## Parsing TypeScript & Flow

By default `@hypermod/cli` will use `babel` as the default parser and only transform files with a `.js` extensions.

If your repo depends on flow or typescript, it's important to remember to specify `ts`, `tsx` or `flow` as the `--parser` and or `jsx, ts, tsx` as `--extensions` to make sure jscodeshift can interpret the files properly.

Please refer to the [@hypermod/cli API reference](/docs/cli) for more information.
