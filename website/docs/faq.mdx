## Why jscodeshift?

By default, CodeshiftCommunity uses JSCodeshift because it is the most commonly used AST transformation library in the community. Many codemods are already written with JSCodeshift, and our goal is to consolidate these codemods in one place.

However, we are compatible with any JS-based AST transformation library, such as **Babel**, **PostCSS**, and **esprima**. We also provide guides for using non-JSCodeshift libraries, and we aim to support the transformation of any target file, including but not limited to JS, TS, CSS, LESS, Sass, and JSON.
